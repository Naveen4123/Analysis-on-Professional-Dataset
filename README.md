# Analysis-on-Professional-Dataset
Performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and gain insights into the relationships between key variables. This analysis will serve as the foundation for data-driven decision-making or predictive modeling.
# 📊 Data Analysis on Professional Dataset

## 🧭 Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a professional dataset involving employee-related variables such as `Employment Type`, `Job Role`, and `Manager Approval`. The goal is to uncover patterns, derive meaningful insights, and support data-driven decisions — a vital step before applying advanced analytics or machine learning.

## 🎯 Goal

- Understand data distribution and structure
- Identify key relationships between job roles and employment types
- Analyze the approval behavior of managers across different employee categories
- Detect missing values and handle data quality issues

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about:
- **Employment_Type** (e.g., Full-Time, Part-Time)
- **Job_Role** (e.g., Data Analyst, HR Manager)
- **Manager_Approval** (e.g., Approved, Rejected)
- Other columns that help segment and understand employee dynamics.

> **Note:** The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps in EDA

1. **Loading & Understanding the Data**
2. **Handling Missing Values**
3. **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**
4. **Cross-tabulation Analysis**:
   - Employment Type vs Job Role vs Manager Approval
5. **Visualization**:
   - Bar charts, heatmaps, and more
6. **Generating Key Insights for business understanding**
